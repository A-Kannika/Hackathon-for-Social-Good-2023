# Hackathon-for-Social-Good-2023: Women Who Code

  After the recession of 2020, many people lost their jobs, the new college/university graduates couldn't find jobs, and many families needed to find extra jobs to make extra money. However, doing more than one or two on-site jobs takes work. So, many people are looking for remote work opportunities, especially jobs that are flexible and fit their time, jobs that they can do anytime and anywhere, jobs without any pressure, and can be passive income.

## The objectives of our project are:

  To help people looking for remote work opportunities, I decided to develop a website to provideï»¿ many categories, online marketplaces, and extra valuable resources for online remote workers that can help save their time, make it easy to understand, and prepare them ready to apply.

## Audience:
1. Unemployment people
2. The new college/university graduations
3. Mothers
4. Whoever wants extra jobs to make extra money
